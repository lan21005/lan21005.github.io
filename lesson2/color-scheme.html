      <h1>Requierment</h1>
      <p>
        Feference the elements/content to which the colors will apply. This
        means that you need to provide examples and actual values as
        demonstrated in the reading.

      <h1>Color Palette</h1>
      <p>
        The color palette is a set of colors that are used to represent the
        elements of the website. The colors are chosen to be consistent with the
        website's overall design. The color palette is divided into two
        sections: primary and secondary. The primary colors are used for the
        main elements of the website, such as the header, the footer, and the
        main content. The secondary colors are used for the elements that are
        not the main elements of the website, such as the links, buttons, and
        the text. The primary colors are chosen to be consistent with the
        website's overall design. The secondary colors are chosen to be
        consistent with the website's overall design.
      </p>
      <h1>Color Contrast</h1>
      <p>
        The color contrast is a set of guidelines that are used to ensure that
        the text and background colors of the website are sufficient to meet the
        accessibility requirements of the website. The color contrast is divided
        into two sections: primary and secondary. The primary colors are used
        for the main elements of the website, such as the header, the footer,
        and the main content. The secondary colors are used for the elements
        that are not the main elements of the website, such as the links,
        buttons, and the text. The primary colors are chosen to be consistent
        with the website's overall design. The secondary colors are chosen to be
        consistent with the website's overall design.
