      <h1>5 Scenarios</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Scenario 1:</li>
        
          Two College biology students, Lexi and Emily, are planning a trip to
          the mountains to observe various local plants and animals. They are
          planning to camp overnight in the mountains. They are checking the
          weather to see if they can camp in their tent, or if they will be
          sleeping in the car.
        

        <li>Scenario 2:</li>
        
          Erica, a parent to three young children, checks the daily weather
          forcase before picking out her children's clothes for the day. She
          needs to know if rain is expected and what the high and low
          temperatures are forcasted to be.
        

        <li>Scenario 3:</li>
        
          The Skywalker family is planning a surprise birthday party for their
          young twin children, Luke and Leia. To make sure that the party is as
          great as possible, they need to know the weather forcasted for the
          next few days. If it is going to rain, they should plan to bring an
          umbrella. If it is going to snow, they should plan to bring a
          snowshoe, and if it is going to be a storm, they should plan to bring
          a boat.
        
        <li>Scenario 4:</li>
        
          The Payton Child Youth Services is hosting a soccer tournament for the
          local intramural teams. They need to know the expected temperatures
          and weather forcasted for the weekend, so they can send out an email
          to all the parents. They will keep track of the forcasted weather in
          case they need to reschedule the tournament.
        
        <li>Scenario 5:</li>
        
          A local high school teacher is looking at taking some time off of from
          their class. They need to know the weather forcasted for the next few
